# Description
Lost a 6/6/6 heir? Losing a war and want to go back? Unfortunately, you can only go back three months to the "older_autosave". Well, with this program, you can autosave infinitely with ease! Simply install, enter the save's name, then enter the what you would like the archived saves to be named, and you're done!

It works by simply renaming old autosaves into new names + the save number. So for example you want all of your autosaves to be renamed to "ottomansrun", then it will automatically detect your autosave and rename them to "ottomansrun 1.eu4". It also remembers, so if you have previously a file named "ottomansrun 69.eu4", then the next time you run it, it will start counting from 69 again and rename them to 70 and so on.

You install it by placing it in your "save games" folder then running it. It will always assume it is in the "save games" folder.

You CAN (but you shouldn't) use it for iron man by inputting it with the name of the save, but otherwise for normal autosaves you can input "/autosave" and it will archive every autosave in the save games folder.

# How to use
1. Install the program in the folder of your Europa Universalis save folder. (usually located in "Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\save games")
2. Start the program.
3. Select the name of the saves to be archived. (if "/autosave" is inputted, then autosaves will be archived)
4. Select the name that the save should be renamed to.
5. Finished! Let it run while you play.
